# Diffusion
Welcome!

This is an implementation of the diffusion model on the MNIST dataset as part of
DT8122 Project Assignment. The results are compared with an existing implementation of
the Bayesian Flow Network (BFN).
 
Here we provide information about
1. Installation
2. Usage
3. Notebooks
4. Report

## 1. Installation
The required packages are listed in the file requirements.txt. To install them, use:\
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 2. Usage
To code is included in a single python file: `main.py`.

## 3. Notebooks
The Jupyter Notebook used for running the code with saved cell outputs can be found in:
`notebooks/diffusion-mnist.ipynb`. In addition, an implementation of the BFN taken from
`https://github.com/Algomancer/Bayesian-Flow-Networks` is included for comparison in
`notebooks/BFN_MNIST.ipynb`.

## 4. Report
The report including the implementation and plots related to both Diffusion model and
Bayesian Flow Network can be found at: `docs/report.pdf`
